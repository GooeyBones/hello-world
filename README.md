# hello-world
My name is David! I'm trying to learn how to code as a means to get out of the monotony of retail work! I also really enjoy problem solving and found through the years that it might be something I'm good at.
I love japan, drawing, lo fi music, and a whole bunch of other stuff you'll have to meet me to find out. I'm looking forward to learning and overcomming obsticales in the months and years ahead!
